# eeg_python
This project is designed to perform topological barcode analysis for EEGs.
#Setup 
    Open the .txt
    add your file directory (has to be .edf if you using the raw file)
    Copy into python line.
Resize the EEG through the main code. 
More often than not, it will not process the whole EEG as one file even though this uses cython implement.I plan on expanding the functionality of this. 
This was made as a project for my Master's program at Nova Southeastern University.
