# Explaining the stuff
This is a repository for lessons covering more basic Python concepts, catered to the coaches. Based on the age level, you can have any number of lessons using the points brought up here. This probably does not include everything but should be a good way to start. It is in alpha v2, so it is subject to a lot of revision. This is designed for the coach hopeful looking to learn Python or the coach who wants to brush up their skills. I also included some good resources (sites and videos) which helped me. Do what works best for you. Happy learning!

# How to use
Each module has a few bite-sized lessons and a set of activities to do after them. The activities are designed for students but I encourage any coach learning Python to try them to get the concepts too and really understand them at that. You may need to tweak the requirements based on age so use your best judgement for that.

# What is there so far
So far there are 4 modules and change so far and I will be adding in the remaining lessons as I come up with corresponding activities.
