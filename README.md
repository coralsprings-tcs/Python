# Explaining the stuff
This is a repository for lessons covering more basic Python concepts. This probably does not include everything but should as a good way to start. It is in alpha-beta, so subject to revision. Each lesson may be one or more sessions, depending on how quick the student gets everything. This also includes some of the tricks I use as a Python developer so is probably different from how others would explain it. I highly encourage the student to look up stuff they do not understand as it is one of the best methods for practicing critical thinking skills in my view (#NotATeacher). I also included some good resources (sites and videos) which helped me. Do what works best for you and for the student. Happy learning!
