# Purpose of this branch
For items that I will be adding in as the curriculum is more fleshed out. I recommend using Python 3.10 or later (ideally 3.11 for better debug, performance, and longevity, especially when 3.11.2+ is most recent version)

# Possible ideas for flask site
* Ways to inject html and javascript in
* Have vulnerabilities in copies of it or specific pages to show importance of good coding and as a challenge
