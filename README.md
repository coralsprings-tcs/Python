# Explaining the stuff
This is a repository for lessons covering more basic Python concepts. This probably does not include everything but should as a good way to start. It is in alpha v2, so it is subject to a lot of revision. I highly encourage the student to look up stuff they do not understand as it is one of the best methods for practicing critical thinking skills in my view (#NotATeacher). I also included some good resources (sites and videos) which helped me. Do what works best for you and for the student. Happy learning!

# How to use
Each module has a few bite-sized lessons and a set of activities to do after them. 

# What is there so far
So far there are 2 modules so far and I will be adding in the remaining lessons as I come up with corresponding activities.
