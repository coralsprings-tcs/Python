Prime numbers are numbers divisible by (divide evenly into) themselves and 1. For example, think of factors for 7 and 3. Then think of factors for 4 and 14. 

The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19 (1 is a special number in this discussion).

Modulus operations are fancy ways of saying you get the remainder of something. 5 % 2 (the remainder of 5 divided by 2) is 1. 6 % 3 will be 0 (6 divided by 3 does not give a remainder, meaning 3 times something will give 6).

That's all the math you need to know for this to work. Now onto how the code should work.

# The Goal
* Go from 1 to 100, looking for prime numbers (remember 1 is not prime so think of how to account for it)
* Make use of the inbuilt range function and modulus operator
* You can print directly, add to a list of prime numbers which prints later on, or however you want to do it

Refer to prime_numbers.py for a way of doing it. For an added challenge try explaining why I did it that way! As a note, the range function returns 1 to x-1, meaning range(1,10) will give 1,2,3,...9 and NOT 10. It can be iterated through like any list as well.
