# Binary Chop (taken from Book of Python Projects)
## Things you'll need
* The template in this folder
* A marker and a board if you need to think out how the code should go

## The Goal
What you'll be trying to do is the following:
* Have the computer pick a random integer between (and including) 1 and 100
* Compare your guess to the chosen number.
* If too high:
    * Computer says so and to try lower
* If too low:
    * Computer says so and to try higher
* If the guess is equal to it:
    * Computer says you got it

## Challenges
* Limit the number of possible guesses to 7, and the game is over when > 7 is reached
* A prompt to try again automatically (ie. Would you like to try again?)

When you're done try it out and compare it to the two Python files in this folder. There are no "more correct" ways of doing this. Use match statements, if-else, functions, or any other way you can think of.
