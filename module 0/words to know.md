# Words to Know (Super simple definitions that are probably inaccurate)
* Path: found under System Environment. It makes the system recognize a program or folder basically. 
* Programming languages: ways for a user to "communicate" with a computer. These can be as basic as BASIC or bash (scripting languages), no pun intended, or as advanced as C++ or Ruby (object oriented languages). They mainly fall under 2 camps:
    * Compiled: they interact more closely with the underlying architecture of the computer. They tend to be less readily understood but are faster as they have less layers of the CPU to deal with. They are also more specific so require more user knowledge of the ins and outs of the used operating system.
    * Interpeted: they tend to be more user-friendly (debatable with C# but I digress) and portable (ie. Python works for all major systems because the interpeter itself does the heavy lifting there) but slower. For quick, quality videos that saved me on interviews look at the following:
