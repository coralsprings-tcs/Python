# Install stuff
Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
Install the most recent version
Add Python to the path if it is not in there. This can be checked by entering the following in cmd prompt:
```bash
python
# You can check by doing the below to find it
where python
# Check python version
python --version
```
You will also want to check for PIP (the package installer for Python):
```bash
pip
# If the Python executable is found at C:/Python311/Python.exe, pip should be at C:/Python311/Scripts. Google the specifics for adding PIP to the path for a more detailed explanation
# Check where pip is installed
where pip 
# Checks the pip version and python version it is associated with (more important if for some reason a computer has multiple python versions)
pip --version
```
