* This next module will dive into the more complicated aspects for those new to programming: object oriented concepts in Python. 
* There are a number of resources on YouTube that can help explain what I made here. 
* At least for me, the best way is to try stuff yourself. If you wonder what happens if you do something, try it out and see what happens. Then see if you can reverse engineer what happened. 
* There are any number of ways to go about this but I will be sticking to the main points.
* Knowing it may help the students but it is not necessary however it helps the person teaching understand why Python goes about things this way and how to write good code.
