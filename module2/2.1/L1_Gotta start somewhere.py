print("Hello, World!")

# As you can see, the first program consists of the following parts:
# - the word print;
# - an opening parenthesis;
# - a quotation mark;
# - a line of text: Hello, World!; (note how the console will not print the quotes)
# - another quotation mark;
# - a closing parenthesis.
