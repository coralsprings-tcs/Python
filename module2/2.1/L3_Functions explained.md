Functions in python consist of a few parts:
```python
def some_function(argument1,argument2):
    # some logic
    return output # This part is optional
```
Calling it consists of using the function and any arguments it uses (if any) as below:
```python
some_function(argument1, argument2) # two parameters are used since that is what the function calls for
```
