The Fibonacci sequence follows a sequence where you add the two previous terms to get the next term such as below:
```
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,...
```
Try coming up with other sequences that do the same thing for practice. Now for coding...

# The Goal
Make a function that can do the same thing, using 0 and/or positive numbers as initial inputs and any number of terms where n > 0.

A comparison is in fib.py
