# Applying and Thinking in Functions
Try recreating the activities from module 1 in functions. Here are some ideas:
* For tictactoe, try having a function that creates the board, another that updates it, a function that checks for win conditions, etc.
* For fib, try having a function so you can change the number of terms you put in and your initial values and either print or return a sequence.
* For binary chop, you can try again, make the guess, etc. (binary_chop_with_challenge.py makes use of functions)
* HINT: use what you already made last time, make a copy, and break it down into functions using the steps that go into doing each thing
