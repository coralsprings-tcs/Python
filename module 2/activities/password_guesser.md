# Password guesser
Try making something that guesses a password using the following template but you can make your own design. Look at the Python file when you're done.
```python
possible_passwords = ['something','password123','a thing', 'a password']
password = ['password123']
# Input your guess and the password, get True or False
def guess_password_with_input(guess:str, password:str) -> bool:
    pass # Function placeholder
    # if equal to password return true
    # else false 
# What will you say if the guess is the password? How will you go through the list to get the password?
# Can you improve upon this?
```
