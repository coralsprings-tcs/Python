# How to get Python
## Windows
Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/. Check to add Python to PATH in the installation process and use default settings otherwise. This will save you some time.

## Linux
Install using apt or whatever package manager your distro uses.

## Start Work
To start your work, you need the following tools:
* an editor which will support you in writing the code (it should have some special features, not available in simple tools); this dedicated editor will give you more than the standard OS equipment;
* a console in which you can launch your newly written code and stop it forcibly when it gets out of control;
* a tool named a debugger, able to launch your code step-by-step, which will allow you to inspect it at each moment of execution.

Besides its many useful components, the Python 3 standard installation contains a very simple but extremely useful application named IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment).

<b>Note:</b> don't set any extension for the file name you are going to use. Python needs its files to have the .py extension, so you should rely on the dialog window's defaults. Using the standard .py extension enables the OS to properly open these files.
